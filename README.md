# <p align="center">ReNu App</p>
  
✨It is a project that is an intermediary application between the company responsible for recycling waste and
the user.The user can download it and then deal with the application simply by placing an order through the
application. Also, the user can upload an antique that he wants to sell at auction, and we can deal with more
than one company in all governorates.Its aim is to increase awareness of the importance of recycling and its
positive impact on the environment and environmental protection.
